# FortiOS Tools (and other stuff)

> Various tools to make my FortiLife easier (sometimes)

## The Premise
I've been spending more time in the FortiGate CLI during deployments and migrations, and have been creating bash scripts and Ansible playbooks and other more efficient tools to help with this process.

## The Stuff
There are some basic scripts that will take an input of various information, and output it into a FortiOS compatible format

### Scripts
- Named lists to FortiOS (`named-list-2-fortios.py`)
- Bulk lists to be automatically named (`address-list-2-fortios.py`)

More coming soon
